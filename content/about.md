:wave: I'm Jonathan, a DevOps Engineer with a passion for automation. My work revolves around building structured, reusable Infrastructure-as-Code configurations and pipeline configurations.

:desktop_computer: In my tech journey, I started off as a Systems Engineer before embarking on my journey as a Software Developer and finally ended up as a DevOps Engineer.

I work primarily with technologies such as 
  
  - Terraform with multiple cloud service providers
  
  - GitLab CI

  - Bash (and other scripting languages)

:briefcase: I am currently an Individual Contributor at Government Technology Agency (GovTech) Singapore, but with a goal of transitioning to engineering management. I believe in creating a safe and productive space for up and coming junior engineers to shine.

:mag: In my free time, I spend time tinkering with my homelab that is hosted on a mini PC, where it powers a Proxmox Virtual Environment and a Kubernetes cluster running on TalosOS.

:video_game: I also like to play games, particularly automtation games such as Satisfactory and shapez. I am also trying to start a habit of blogging to note down [my shenanigans](../../blogs)!
