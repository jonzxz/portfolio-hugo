Hi there, I'm Jonathan, a DevOps Engineer with a passion for automation. My work revolves around building structured, reusable Infrastructure-as-Code configurations and pipeline configurations.

In my tech journey, I started off as a Systems Engineer before embarking on my journey as a software developer and finally ended up as a DevOps Engineer, working with Terraform with multiple cloud service providers and GitLab CI extensively.

I am currently an Individual Contributor, but with a goal of transitioning to engineering management. I believe in creating a safe and productive space for up and coming junior engineers to shine.

In my free time, I spend time tinkering with my homelab that is hosted on a mini PC, where it powers a Proxmox Virtual Environmenet and a Kubernetes cluster running on TalosOS. I also like to play games, particularly automtation games such as Satisfactory and shapez. I am also trying to start a habit of blogging to note down my shenanigans!

P.S. This is actually version 2 of my portfolio site hosted on TODO. For the original portfolio site written in React that I no longer maintain, head over to [old.jonathankerk.com](https://old.jonathankerk.com) to take a look!
